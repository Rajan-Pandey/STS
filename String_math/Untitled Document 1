The first line of input will contain a single integer N, stating the number of snakes and ladders.
• Next N lines each will contain a pair of integers. Each pair will describe either a snake or ladder by its start cell and an end cell. For example, for a snake, start cell will be higher than end cell. Refer to the first sample input case which describes the board in the figure above.
• Following line of input has a single integer D, indicating the number of moves (dice throws) made by both players A and B.
• Last line contains D integers, each indicating a dice throw, alternately made by A and B. First throw is made by player A. Each dice throw is an integer between 1 to 6.

Your program should output the name of the winner (A or B) followed by the players position
at the end of game, with a single space in between
